**Cinema Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
**Overview**
Explore the cinema dataset, which includes information such as film code, cinema code, total sales, tickets sold, show time, occupancy percentage, ticket price, ticket usage, capacity, date, month, quarter, and day. This EDA aims to uncover insights and patterns within the dataset, providing valuable information for analysis and decision-making.

**Visualizations and Analyses**
Time Series Plot
Visualize the temporal trends in total sales, tickets sold, and other relevant metrics with time series plots. These plots provide a comprehensive view of how these metrics evolve over time, helping to identify seasonal patterns, trends, and potential anomalies.


Correlation Analysis
Explore the relationships between different variables through correlation analysis. Identify which features are strongly correlated and understand how changes in one variable may impact others. This analysis aids in understanding the dataset's structure and potential dependencies.

Predictive Modeling
Build predictive models to forecast future total sales or other relevant metrics. Utilize machine learning techniques to create models that can provide insights into potential outcomes, helping in decision-making and strategic planning.

**About Dataset**
**Context**
Cinema industry is not excluded of getting advantage of predictive modeling. Like other industry e.g. retail , banking and restaurants , sale forecast
can help cinemas for cost reduction and better ROI. By forecasting sale, screening in different location could be optimized as well as effective market targeting and pricing.

Also historical data of sale and movies details e.g. cost, cast and crews, and other project details like schedule, could help producers to select high performance cast and crews and planning for better projects ROI . Also it helps to assign screening location on hot spots and areas.
